# Hello, I'm Handan Özcan

- **Contact**: handanozcan12@gmail.com
- **Location**: İstanbul, Turkey
- **About Me**: 
  - I am a Digital Media Specialist and an advertising graduate. I’m still trying to figure out how to use this app, but it looks cool, right? So here I am, learning the ropes while pretending to be a coding wizard!
  - When I’m not tangled up in code, you can find me binge-watching the latest Netflix series or convincing my friends that I’m a gourmet chef after mastering instant noodles.
  - Fun fact: I once tried to build a robot to do my homework, but it just ended up playing video games instead. So now I’m here, making sure my coding skills are up to par!

### Why This Project?
- This project is my first attempt at using GitHub. If you see any typos, just assume I’m being avant-garde! 
- I hope to use this repository to document my journey into the world of digital marketing and performance. If it turns out like my cooking experiments, it might be a wild ride!
